Project for CSC300

TODO IMMEDIATE:
* finish implementing mailer for contacting about space - just finish up the mailer and controller methods. Make sure to comment out the actual sending - we don't want emails going out from this app in production
* add required-type icon for form field labels
* field spacing is off for sending message
* clean up colors to match
* header menu isn't displaying at minized mobile size
* implement redirect flashes (start with the sending email one in the spaces controller)


TODO LATER
* ratings for space
* breadcrumbs for province/spaces on browsing

NICE TO HAVES - all users are low priority now:
* get sign in + sign in errors working
* get current user and sessions working
* get space creation + indexing working
